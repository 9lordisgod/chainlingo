**Duolingo-style crypto education for Solana Mobile (Seeker)** — daily lessons, streaks, points, optional Seeker wallet connect for progress sync. Curriculum content lives in the private sibling repo `chainlingo-content`.

> **Honesty:** This is a fresh scaffold. No live curriculum ship, no App Store listing, no custody, no trading.

## What this repo owns

- App shell (Expo / React Native target for Seeker)
- UI + gamification logic (XP, streaks, daily goals) — stubs first
- Solana Mobile Wallet Adapter (MWA) **connect / disconnect** only — never signs trades, never holds keys
- Database schema + migrations for progress / entitlements

## What this repo does **not** own

- Question bank, path text, or answer keys → `chainlingo-content` (private)
- Trading, swaps, sniping, or wallet custody
- Code copied from `cypherpunk-code` / `cypherpunk-mobile` (inspiration only: multi-path learning)

## Principles

1. **Education first** — lessons and practice, not a terminal.
2. **Propose / connect only** — wallet is optional identity + progress sync; keys never enter lesson UI.
3. **Content split** — public app, private curriculum so answer keys stay closed.
4. **No overclaims** — stubs labeled stubs.

## Sibling content repo

Private: https://github.com/9lordisgod/chainlingo-content  
The app loads packaged or signed content snapshots; it does not embed answer keys in this tree.
